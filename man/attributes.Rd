\title{Attributes for CSV input files TripleD database}
\format{A dataframe with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{Attribute}}{The name of the attribute as it should be used as column name in the CSV.}
\item{\code{Unit}}{The unit the attribute should have.}
\item{\code{Required_or_Optional}}{Whether or not the attribute is required.
If this is filled with 'Required_alternative' it means the information is required, but can be given in different ways.}

}
\description{
Data frame with information on all attributes that should or could be
included in the CSVs that act as input for the formation of the database.
}
\details{
TripleD data is summarized per cruise in CSVs that can be read by
the package in order to create a database. These CSVs either contain station
or species data. The format of these CSVs, thus, the names of all variables
and the exact meaning of the values in those columns, is explained here.
\cr
A dataframe exists for the station CSVs called 'stations_att' and for the species
CSVs called 'species_att'.
\cr
It is also possible to include data to convert sizes and wet weights to ash-free dry weights.
This data should be included in a file called 'bioconversion.csv'.
The requirements for this file can be found in 'bioconversion_att'.
