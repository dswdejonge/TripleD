\usage{
collect_external_data(
  stations = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  conversion_taxa = NULL,
  lats = NULL,
  lons = NULL,
  input_folder = "inputfiles",
  data_folder = "data",

}
\arguments{
\item{stations}{The initial database for stations with track midpoints.
If NULL (default) the function will automatically search the data_folder for 'stations_initial.rda'.}

\item{species}{The initial database for species with reported specimen names.
If NULL (default) the function will automatically search the data_folder for 'species_initial.rda'.}

\item{conversion_taxa}{A vector with taxa names from the bioconversion.csv file that should be
compared against the WoRMS database. If NULL (default) the function will automatically search the
input_folder for the 'bioconversion.csv' file.}

\item{lats}{(optional) You can specify latitudes you want to use to collect bathymetry.
If not specified, the track midpoints in the database are used.}

\item{lons}{(optional) You can specify longitudes you want to use to collect bathymetry.
If not specified, the track midpoints in the database are used.}

\item{input_folder}{The folder where to find the bioconversion.csv file. Default is 'inputfiles'.}

\item{data_folder}{If the stations and/or species database are not provided, the function will search
for it ('stations_initial.rda' and 'species_initial.rda') in this folder. Default is 'data'.}

\item{out_folder}{The external data is stored in this folder. Default is 'data'.}

\item{as_CSV}{If you also want to store the collected external data as CSV, set to TRUE. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object, but stores the information in the specified
\code{out_folder} under the names 'bathymetry.rda' and 'worms.rda'.
}
\description{
This function collects external data from NOAA and WoRMS.
}
\details{
Bathymetry data is collected from the NOAA database using the \code{marmap} R-package.
You need internet connection to do this. The default resolution is 1 minute.
You can also choose to collect your own bathymetry with a different resolution from NOAA by using the
package function \code{collect_bathymetry}, or not to collect bathymetry externally at all
if you have your own dataset.
\cr
Taxonomic data is collected from the WoRMS database using the \code{worrms} R-package.
You need internet connection to do this.
The reported taxonomic names of the specimens in the initial database and in the bioconversion.csv file
are matched against the WoRMS database (also fuzzy matches, i.e. where typos and phonetic spelling is allowed).
