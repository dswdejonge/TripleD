Attribute,Unit,Required_or_Optional,Group,Datatype,Description
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,Required,NA,String,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Otherwise <cruise name>_<station number>. Very important because it is used to match species observations to station data."
Fraction,0-1,Required,1,Double,"The fraction of the catch that has been processed for this species. For example, if 10 crabs were caught, but only 5 were reported and weighted, the fraction is 0.5. This is used in later analysis to upscale the values if necessary."
isFractionAssumed,0 or 1,Required,1,Boolean,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""Fraction"" was not specified in the original data thus it was assumed to be the reported value (isFractionAssumed = 1 i.e. yes), or if ""Fraction"" was reported specifically in the original data (isFractionAssumed = 0 i.e. no)."
Species_reported,Genus species,Required,NA,String,The species name as reported in the original data files (so not updated to revised species names).
Count,Count,Required,NA,Integer,"Count of number of specimens of the specified size found in this specific fraction. If Count = 1 the measurements come from an individual, if Count > 1 the measurement belongs to a group of species of size Count, if Count = -1
(often historical data) it concerns observations like eggs, rest material, empty worm tubes, seaweed batches, etc."
Unit_Length,"mm, cm, 1/2cm",Optional,2,String,"The unit in which the length of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Length is given."
Length,Specified in Unit_Length.,Optional,2,Double,"Length of the (group of) specimen(s) reported as a number of units. The unit used for length measurements is reported in Unit_Length. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about the standardized length measurements. If Length = 0, it means the actual size was smaller than the specified Unit_Length. For example, if the unit is 1/2cm and the length is 0, the actual length was between 0 and 0.5 cm. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
Unit_Width,"mm, cm, 1/2cm",Optional,3,String,"The unit in which the length of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Width is given."
Width,Specified in Unit_Width.,Optional,3,Double,"Width of the (group of) specimen(s) reported as a number of units. The unit used for width measurements is reported in Unit_Width. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about the standardized width measurements. If Width = 0, it means the actual size was smaller than the specified Unit_Width. For example, if the unit is 1/2cm and the length is 0, the actual length was between 0 and 0.5 cm. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
WetWeight_g,Grams,Optional,4,Double,"Wet weight of the (group of) specimen(s) in grams. Wet weight is assumed to concern the whole organism including the shell, unless specified otherwise in the column 'isWithShell'. If the WetWeight was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included WetWeight as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_Scale'). Only include numbers for WetWeight (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
isBulkWeight,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""WetWeight_g"" concerns bulk weight i.e. of multiple specimens (isBulkWeight = 1 i.e. yes, or isBulkWeight = 0 i.e. no). If the reported WetWeight is only for one individual (so count is 1 and no weight of other entries were included in the scale) then isBulkWeight = 0. If isBulkWeight = 1, in later analysis all WetWeight of the species in this particular sample is summed with the exception of entries with isBulkWeight = 0. For examples, see the vignette 'adding_data.Rmd'. Required if WetWeight is given."
Threshold_Scale,Grams,Optional,4,Double,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.5 grams, report 0.5 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported WetWeight of 0. Required if WetWeight is given."
isWithShell,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"If the reported WetWeight concerns the organism without the shell, set isWithShell to 0. Otherwise set to 1 or NA."
isPartialWW,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"If the reported WetWeight concerns only part of the organism, set isPartialWW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0 or NA. If the organism is weighted without shell (isWithShell = 0), but the internal flesh was intact, you should set isPartialWW to 0."
ID_by,NA,Optional,NA,String,Name of the person that identified and processed the sample.
isPreserved,0 or 1,Optional,NA,Boolean,"If the specimen(s) is/are preserved and taken back to NIOZ for later analysis, set isPreserved to 1, otherwise to 0 or NA."
Comment,NA,Optional,NA,String,Additional comments about the sample.
