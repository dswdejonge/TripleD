IGNORE,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When constructing the CSV files with 1) all species and 2) all stations information, please also provide a file called ""<year>_<CruiseID>_README.txt. This textfile should function as a sort of log file, where you describe how the information was collected on this particular. Specifically, if you had to alter your original data in order to meet the requirements specified in these attributes files, provide a detailed description of how you did this. For example, the coordinate system in which you recorded your sample points did not correspond to the coordinate system assumed in the TripleD package. Therefore, you converted the coordinates from the one system to the other using a specific R-function. This should be reported in the readme file: what was the original coordinate system, and what method was employed to convert it to the required coordinate system? This readme will allow future users of the data to understand how the collection of data changed over time. (Note: this row is ignored by the TripleD package and is only to notify you of the need for a readme file.) Checklist for readme file: Your name; the date you latest updated the CSV file; what cruise this readme file belongs to; which raw data files you have used and perhaps where one could find those data; any general remarks about the cruise or data; for the stations CSV how each column was filled incl. any assumptions, calculations, conversions, and code; for the species CSV how each column was filled incl. any assumptions, calculations, conversions, and code."
EntryID,CruiseID_rownr,Required,String,NA,"A unique ID for EVERY ENTRY in the file. Can be created as StationID_rownr. Once an EntryID has been assigned to an observation, it should not be changed anymore! In other words, if a row is added in the middle of the dataset at a later point, it should NOT get the rownr combined with the StationID, but for example the StationID combined with a number which is the former highest rownr + 1. The EntryID can be used to match external data to the database. For example, if isotope measurements have been done on the tissue of an organism caught with the TripleD, the EntryID can be used to match to isotope data to the corresponding TripleD catch."
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,Required,String,NA,"A unique ID for the sampling event where this species was observed (so not a unique ID per entry), preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match species observations to station data."
Fraction,Fraction,Required,Double,1,"The fraction (between 0 and 1) of the total catch that has been processed for this species. For example, if 10 crabs were caught, but only 5 were reported and weighted, the fraction is 0.5. This is used in later analysis to upscale the values for the whole catch. The reported fraction should be the same for each entry that has the same station and taxon combination."
is_Fraction_assumed,0 or 1,Required,Boolean,1,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""Fraction"" was not specified in the original data thus it was assumed to be the reported value (is_Fraction_assumed = 1 i.e. yes), or if ""Fraction"" was reported specifically in the original data (is_Fraction_assumed = 0 i.e. no). The reported is_Fraction_assumed should be the same for each entry with the same station and taxon combination."
Species_reported,Genus species,Required,String,NA,"The species name as reported in the original data files. It is not necessary to update them according to modern taxonomic accepted names, because all names are automatically checked against WoRMS in the TripleD R-package. Preferably the specimens are identified to species level, however, if this is not possible a higher taxonomic level is also accepted (e.g. genus, family, etc.)."
Count,Count,Optional,Integer,NA,"Count of the number of specimens of the specified size found in this specific fraction. If Count = 1 the size and weight measurements come from one individual, if Count is larger than 1 the measurements belong to a group of species of size Count, if Count = NA the speciments were present but not counted for some reason, if Count = -1 (often historical data) it concerns observations like eggs, rest material, empty worm tubes, seaweed batches, etc. If Count = 0, it is the same as Count = NA."
Size_dimension,"Predefined: Body_length, Body_width, Diameter, Shell_length, Shell_width, Shell_heigth, Siphon_width, Claw_length, Claw_width, Carapace_length, Carapace_width, Max_length, Arm_disc_length, Disc_diameter, Mantle_length, Area",Optional,String,2,"The morphological dimension of the organism that was measured. Please refer to the vignette to view a diagram that specifies how measuring dimensions are named. If your measurement does not fit any of the predefined descriptions, please convert the measured dimension to one of the allowed dimensions and document this conversion in the readme text file that accompanies the CSV. For organisms without a characteristic form (like some sponges and ascidians) sometimes an estimated area is reported, therefore the dimension Area is also allowed in this column; make sure the Size_unit is set to mm2 or cm2."
Size_value,Specified in Size_unit.,Optional,Double,2,"Size of the (group of) specimen(s) reported in the unit as noted in 'Size_unit'. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5). Beware that 1/2cm are actually size classes, which allow a Size_value of 0, meaning the actual size was between 0 and 5 mm."
Size_unit,"Predefined: mm, cm, 1/2cm, mm2, cm2",Optional,String,2,"The unit in which the size of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Size_value is given. Only use mm2 or cm2 if the area of an organism without a characteristic form (like sponges) is given."
WW_g,Grams,Optional,Double,4,"Wet weight of the (group of) specimen(s) in grams. Wet weight is assumed to concern the whole organism including the shell, unless specified otherwise in the column 'is_Shell_removed'. If the wet weight was not measured, include NA (so NOT 0). Also set WW_g to NA if the wet weight was measured as part of a bulk weight that is reported in another row (see column 'Weight_type'). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included WW_g as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_scale'). Only include numbers for WW_g (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
Weight_type,"Predefined: Entry, Sample",Optional,String,4,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported wet weight. If the reported weight is only for the entry (i.e row) under consideration, then Weight_type = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then Weight_type = Sample. The rows that have no reported weight but are included in the bulk sample should also be set to 'Sample'. In other words, all specimens that are included in the bulk weight must be identified with the Weight_type = Sample. Set Weight_type to NA if no weight at all is reported, also not in the bulk (Sample) weight. "
Threshold_scale,Grams,Optional,Double,4,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.5 grams, report 0.5 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported wet weight of 0. Required if WW_g is given."
is_Shell_removed,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,4,"Required if WW_g is given. is_Shell_removed = 1 if the organism under consideration occurs naturally with shell, but the shell was removed for weighing (so only flesh was weighted). In all other cases set to 0."
is_Partial_WW,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,4,"If the reported wet weight concerns only part of the organism, i.e. the organism was broken, set is_Partial_WW to 1, and report in the Comment colum what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. If the organism is weighed without shell (is_Shell_removed = 1), but the internal flesh was intact, you should set is_Partial_WW to 0. Required when WW_g is given."
AFDW_g,Grams,Optional,Double,5,"The ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in grams of the (group of) specimen(s). The AFDW is assumed to concern only the biologically active tissue (so e.g. excluding the shell or exoskeleton). If the AFDW was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). Also set to NA if the AFDW was measured as part of a bulk weight reported in another row (see column ""Weight_type_AFDW""). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included AFDW_g as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_scale_AFDW'). Only include numbers for AFDW_g (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
Weight_type_AFDW,"Predefined: Entry, Sample",Optional,String,5,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported ash free dry weight. If the reported weight is only for the entry (i.e row) under consideration, then Weight_type_AFDW = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then Weight_type_AFDW = Sample. The rows that have no reported weight but are included in the bulk sample should also be set to 'Sample'. In other words, all specimens that are included in the bulk weight must be identified with the Weight_type_AFDW = Sample. Set Weight_type_AFDW to NA if no weight at all is reported, also not in the bulk (Sample) weight."
Threshold_scale_AFDW,Grams,Optional,Double,5,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.005 grams, report 0.005 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported AFDW of 0. Required if AFDW_g is given."
is_Partial_AFDW,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,5,"If the reported AFDW_g concerns only part of the organism, set is_Partial_AFDW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. Required when AFDW_g is given."
ID_by,NA,Optional,String,NA,Name of the person that identified and processed the sample.
is_ID_confident,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,NA,"If there was trouble identifying the reported taxon, this column should be set to is_ID_confident = 0 (i.e. the ID is not confident). The confident IDs should be set to 1. If this column is omitted it is assumed all IDs were confident."
is_Preserved,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,NA,"If the specimen(s) is/are preserved and taken back to a research institute for later analysis, set isPreserved to 1, otherwise to 0 or NA. In the comments you can specify where the specimens can be found."
