Attribute,Unit,Required_or_Optional,Group,Datatype,Description
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,Required,NA,String,"A unique ID for the sampling event where this species was observed (so not a unique ID per entry), preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match species observations to station data."
Fraction,Fraction,Required,1,Double,"The fraction (between 0 and 1) of the total catch that has been processed for this species. For example, if 10 crabs were caught, but only 5 were reported and weighted, the fraction is 0.5. This is used in later analysis to upscale the values for the whole catch. The reported fraction should be the same for each entry that has the same station and taxon combination."
isFractionAssumed,0 or 1,Required,1,Boolean,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""Fraction"" was not specified in the original data thus it was assumed to be the reported value (isFractionAssumed = 1 i.e. yes), or if ""Fraction"" was reported specifically in the original data (isFractionAssumed = 0 i.e. no). The reported isFractionAssumed should be the same for each entry with the same station and taxon combination."
Species_reported,Genus species,Required,NA,String,The species name as reported in the original data files (so not updated to revised species names).
Count,Count,Optional,NA,Integer,"Count of the number of specimens of the specified size found in this specific fraction. If Count = 1 the size and weight measurements come from one individual, if Count is larger than 1 the measurements belong to a group of species of size Count, if Count = NA the speciments were not counted for some reason, if Count = -1 (often historical data) it concerns observations like eggs, rest material, empty worm tubes, seaweed batches, etc."
Unit_Length,"Predefined: mm, cm, 1/2cm",Optional,2,String,"The unit in which the length of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Length is given."
Length,Specified in Unit_Length.,Optional,2,Double,"Length of the (group of) specimen(s) reported as a number of units. The unit used for length measurements is reported in Unit_Length. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about the standardized length measurements. If Length = 0, it means the actual size was smaller than the specified Unit_Length. For example, if the unit is 1/2cm and the length is 0, the actual length was between 0 and 0.5 cm. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
Unit_Width,"Predefined: mm, cm, 1/2cm",Optional,3,String,"The unit in which the length of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Width is given."
Width,Specified in Unit_Width.,Optional,3,Double,"Width of the (group of) specimen(s) reported as a number of units. The unit used for width measurements is reported in Unit_Width. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about the standardized width measurements. If Width = 0, it means the actual size was smaller than the specified Unit_Width. For example, if the unit is 1/2cm and the length is 0, the actual length was between 0 and 0.5 cm. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
WetWeight_g,Grams,Optional,4,Double,"Wet weight of the (group of) specimen(s) in grams. Wet weight is assumed to concern the whole organism including the shell, unless specified otherwise in the column 'isWithShell'. If the WetWeight was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included WetWeight as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_Scale'). Only include numbers for WetWeight (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
isBulkWeight,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""WetWeight_g"" concerns bulk weight i.e. of multiple specimens (isBulkWeight = 1 i.e. yes, or isBulkWeight = 0 i.e. no). If isBulkWeight = 1, in later analysis all WetWeight of the species in this particular sample is summed with the exception of entries with isBulkWeight = 0. For examples, see the vignette 'adding_data.Rmd'. Required if WetWeight is given."
WeightType,"Predefined: Single, Entry, Sample",Optional,4,String,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported wet weight.  If the reported WetWeight is only for one individual (so count is 1 and no weight of other entries were included in the scale) then WeightType = Single. If the reported weight is only for the entry under consideration, which concerns multiple specimens (i.e. Count > 1), then WeightType = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then WeightType = Sample. In other words, if WeightType = Sample it is assumed the total count of all specimens of a certain species at a certain station has the mass reported in WetWeight_g (with the exception of entries that have WeightType Single or Entry). If the weight type is 'Sample' that means only one sample bulk weight value may be given for that combination of species and station, the weight of all other specimens that are included in the bulk weight can be set to zero, as long as their WeightType is also set to 'Sample'. Set to NA if  weight is not reported. "
Threshold_Scale,Grams,Optional,4,Double,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.5 grams, report 0.5 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported WetWeight of 0. Required if WetWeight is given."
isWithShell,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"If the reported WetWeight concerns an organism without a shell, or an organism that should have a shell but the shell is removed before weighing (only flesh), set isWithShell to 0. Otherwise set to 1. Required if WetWeight is given."
isPartialWW,0 or 1,Optional,4,Boolean,"If the reported WetWeight concerns only part of the organism, set isPartialWW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. If the organism is weighted without shell (isWithShell = 0), but the internal flesh was intact, you should set isPartialWW to 0. Required when WetWeight is given."
AFDW_g,Grams,Optional,5,Double,"The ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in grams of the (group of) specimen(s). The AFDW is assumed to concern only the biologically active tissue (so e.g. excluding the shell or exoskeleton). If the AFDW was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included AFDW_g as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_ScaleAFDW'). Only include numbers for AFDW_g (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
WeightTypeAFDW,"Predefined: Single, Entry, Sample",Optional,5,String,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported  AFDW.  If the reported AFDW is only for one individual (so count is 1 and no weight of other entries were included in the scale) then WeightTypeAFDW = Single. If the reported weight is only for the entry under consideration, which concerns multiple specimens (i.e. Count > 1), then WeightTypeAFDW = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then WeightTypeAFDW = Sample. In other words, if WeightTypeAFDW = Sample it is assumed the total count of all specimens of a certain species at a certain station has the mass reported in AFDW (with the exception of entries that have WeightTypeAFDW Single or Entry). If the weight type is 'Sample' that means only one sample bulk weight value may be given for that combination of species and station, the weight of all other specimens that are included in the bulk weight can be set to zero, as long as their WeightTypeAFDW is also set to 'Sample'. Set to NA if  weight is not reported. "
Threshold_ScaleAFDW,Grams,Optional,5,Double,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.005 grams, report 0.005 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported AFDW of 0. Required if AFDW_g is given."
isPartialAFDW,0 or 1,Optional,5,Boolean,"If the reported AFDW_g concerns only part of the organism, set isPartialAFDW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. Required when AFDW_g is given."
ID_by,NA,Optional,NA,String,Name of the person that identified and processed the sample.
isPreserved,0 or 1,Optional,NA,Boolean,"If the specimen(s) is/are preserved and taken back to NIOZ for later analysis, set isPreserved to 1, otherwise to 0 or NA."
Comment,NA,Optional,NA,String,Additional comments about the sample.
