EntryID,CruiseID_rownr,Required,String,NA,"A unique ID for EVERY ENTRY in the file. Can be created as StationID_rownr. Once an EntryID has been assigned to an observation, it should not be changed anymore! In other words, if a row is added in the middle of the dataset at a later point, it should NOT get the rownr combined with the StationID, but the StationID combined with a number which is the former highest rownr + 1. The EntryID can be used to match external data to the database. For example, if isotope measurements have been done on the tissue of an organism caught with the TripleD, the EntryID can be used to match to isotope data to the corresponding TripleD catch."
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,Required,String,NA,"A unique ID for the sampling event where this species was observed (so not a unique ID per entry), preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match species observations to station data."
Fraction,Fraction,Required,Double,1,"The fraction (between 0 and 1) of the total catch that has been processed for this species. For example, if 10 crabs were caught, but only 5 were reported and weighted, the fraction is 0.5. This is used in later analysis to upscale the values for the whole catch. The reported fraction should be the same for each entry that has the same station and taxon combination."
isFractionAssumed,0 or 1,Required,Boolean,1,"Binary boolean to describe if the reported ""Fraction"" was not specified in the original data thus it was assumed to be the reported value (isFractionAssumed = 1 i.e. yes), or if ""Fraction"" was reported specifically in the original data (isFractionAssumed = 0 i.e. no). The reported isFractionAssumed should be the same for each entry with the same station and taxon combination."
Species_reported,Genus species,Required,String,NA,"The species name as reported in the original data files. It is not necessary to update them according to modern taxonomic accepted names, because all names are automatically checked against WoRMS in the TripleD R-package. Preferably the specimens are identified to species level, however, if this is not possible a higher taxonomic level is also accepted (e.g. genus, family, etc.)."
Count,Count,Optional,Integer,NA,"Count of the number of specimens of the specified size found in this specific fraction. If Count = 1 the size and weight measurements come from one individual, if Count is larger than 1 the measurements belong to a group of species of size Count, if Count = NA the speciments were present but not counted for some reason, if Count = -1 (often historical data) it concerns observations like eggs, rest material, empty worm tubes, seaweed batches, etc."
Size_dimension,"Predefined: Length, Width, Siphon, Cheliped_length, Cheliped_width, Carapace_length, Heigth, Area, Arm, Disc",Optional,String,2,"The morphological dimension of the organism that was measured. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about how measuring dimensions are named. The preferred measurement of an organism is always the Length as shown on the diagram in the vignette. If measuring Length is not possible (i.e. broken organism) or a mistake is made and e.g. the width is measured in stead, an alternative dimension may be given. Naturally, the alternative dimensions must match the taxon (Siphon and Height is for bivalves, Carapace and Cheliped is for decapods). If you measurement does not fit any of the predefined descriptions, please convert the measured dimension to one of the allowed dimensions and document this conversion in the relevant package vignette. For organisms without a characteristic form (like sponges and ascidians) sometimes an estimated area is reported, therefore the dimension Area is also allowed in this column. Make sure the Size unit is set to mm2 or cm2."
Size_value,Specified in Size_unit.,Optional,Integer,2,"Size of the (group of) specimen(s) reported as a number of units. The unit used for size measurements is reported in Size_unit. Please refer to the 'processing_method.Rmd' vignette to read about the standardized length measurements. If Size_value = 0, it means the actual size was smaller than the specified Size_unit. For example, if the unit is 1/2cm and the length is 0, the actual length was between 0 and 0.5 cm. Only include numbers (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
Size_unit,"Predefined: mm, cm, 1/2cm, mm2, cm2",Optional,String,2,"The unit in which the size of the (group of) specimen(s) is measured. Can only be predefined units: milimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and half centimeters (1/2cm). Required if Size_value is given. Only use mm2 or cm2 if the area of an organism without a characteristic form (like sponges) is given."
WetWeight_g,Grams,Optional,Double,4,"Wet weight of the (group of) specimen(s) in grams. Wet weight is assumed to concern the whole organism including the shell, unless specified otherwise in the column 'isWithShell'. If the WetWeight was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included WetWeight as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_Scale'). Only include numbers for WetWeight (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
WeightType,"Predefined: Entry, Sample",Optional,String,4,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported wet weight. If the reported weight is only for the entry (i.e row) under consideration, then WeightType = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then WeightType = Sample. The rows that have no reported weight but are included in the bulk sample should also be set to 'Sample'. In other words, all specimens that are included in the bulk weight must be identified with the WeightType = Sample. Set WeightType to NA if no weight at all is reported, also not in the bulk (Sample) weight. "
Threshold_Scale,Grams,Optional,Double,4,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.5 grams, report 0.5 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported WetWeight of 0. Required if WetWeight is given."
isShellRemoved,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,4,"Required if WetWeight is given. Set to isShellRemoved = 1 if the organism under consideration occurs naturally with shell, but the shell was removed for weighing (so only flesh was weighted). In all other cases set to 0."
isPartialWW,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,4,"If the reported WetWeight concerns only part of the organism, i.e. the organism was broken, set isPartialWW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. If the organism is weighted without shell (isWithShell = 0), but the internal flesh was intact, you should set isPartialWW to 0. Required when WetWeight is given."
AFDW_g,Grams,Optional,Double,5,"The ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in grams of the (group of) specimen(s). The AFDW is assumed to concern only the biologically active tissue (so e.g. excluding the shell or exoskeleton). If the AFDW was not measured include NA (so NOT 0). If the weight could not be measured by the scale because it was lighter than the scale's threshold, included AFDW_g as 0 (see also column 'Threshold_ScaleAFDW'). Only include numbers for AFDW_g (so DON'T include values like <0.5)."
WeightTypeAFDW,"Predefined: Entry, Sample",Optional,String,5,"Predefined string that denotes what is included in the reported ash free dry weight. If the reported weight is only for the entry (i.e row) under consideration, then WeightTypeAFDW = Entry. If the reported weight concerns multiple specimens from the sample which are reported over multiple rows, then WeightTypeAFDW = Sample. The rows that have no reported weight but are included in the bulk sample should also be set to 'Sample'. In other words, all specimens that are included in the bulk weight must be identified with the WeightType = Sample. Set WeightTypeAFDW to NA if no weight at all is reported, also not in the bulk (Sample) weight. "
Threshold_ScaleAFDW,Grams,Optional,Double,5,"Report the threshold of the weighting scale used in grams (i.e. if the scale can only measure organisms heavier than 0.005 grams, report 0.005 in this column). This information can be used to still infer biomass information for specimens with a reported AFDW of 0. Required if AFDW_g is given."
isPartialAFDW,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,5,"If the reported AFDW_g concerns only part of the organism, set isPartialAFDW to 1, and report in the Comment what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to 0. Required when AFDW_g is given."
ID_by,NA,Optional,String,NA,Name of the person that identified and processed the sample.
isPreserved,0 or 1,Optional,Boolean,NA,"If the specimen(s) is/are preserved and taken back to NIOZ for later analysis, set isPreserved to 1, otherwise to 0 or NA."
Comment,NA,Optional,String,NA,Additional comments about the sample.
