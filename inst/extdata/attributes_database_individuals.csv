StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,String,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match stations metadata to species observations. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
valid_name,Taxon,String,"The taxonomic name assigned to the reported species/taxon name in the original species CSV files by checking against the accepted names in the WoRMS database. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur, because all taxa that could not be matched against WoRMS are discarded from the database."
is_ID_confident,TRUE or FALSE,Boolean,"If the individual(s) from this entry could not be identified with confidence this column is set to FALSE, otherwise TRUE."
rank,Taxonomic rank,String,"The rank of the valid_name as assigned by checking against the WoRMS database. Possible ranks of the valid_name is: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
genus,Taxonomic rank,String,The genus that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than genus.
family,Taxonomic rank,String,The family that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than family.
order,Taxonomic rank,String,The order that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than order.
class,Taxonomic rank,String,The class that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than class.
phylum,Taxonomic rank,String,The phylum that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than phylum (like kingdom) which is very unlikely.
isFuzzy,TRUE or FALSE,Boolean,If the valid_name was obtained from WoRMS using an algorithm that searches for fuzzy matches (i.e. allows misspellings and phonetic spellings) isFuzzy is TRUE. If the match was exact is Fuzzy will be FALSE.
Count,Number,Integer,The number of organisms included in this particular entry. This count is already corrected for any given fraction and thus represents the full catch. No NA values should occur.

Original sizes in the unit 1/2cm were converted as mm = 1/2cm*5+5. Original sizes in the unit cm were converted as mm = cm*10. Original sizes in the unit cm2 were converted as mm (assumed mm2 if Size_dimension is Area) = cm2*100. Original sizes in the unit cm3 were converted as mm (assumed mm3 if Size_dimension is Volume) = cm3*1000.

is_Shell_removed,TRUE or FALSE,Boolean," is_Shell_removed = TRUE if the organism under consideration occurs naturally with shell, but the shell was removed for weighing (so only flesh was weighted). In all other cases set to FALSE. This field applies not only to Molluscs but also to hermit crabs, tube worms, and other organisms were an external hard shell is easily removed."
is_Partial_WW,TRUE or FALSE,Boolean,"If the reported wet weight concerns only part of the organism, i.e. the organism was broken, set is_Partial_WW to TRUE, and report in the Comment colum what part of the organism was weighted. Otherwise set to FALSE. If the organism is weighed without shell (is_Shell_removed = TRUE), but the internal flesh was intact, you should set is_Partial_WW to FALSE."
is_Fraction_assumed,TRUE or FALSE,Boolean,"Boolean to describe if the reported ""Fraction"" was not specified in the original data thus it was assumed to be the reported value (is_Fraction_assumed = TRUE), or if ""Fraction"" was reported specifically in the original data (is_Fraction_assumed = FALSE)."

is_Quantitative,1 or 0,Boolean,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Station_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete",String,"Sometimes a cruise or sampling station has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track specify: If the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Station_objective = Complete. If some groups were specifically excluded or focussed on i.e. not the full catch was processed, Station_objective = Incomplete. In this case the excluded taxonomic groups should be noted in the column ""Excluded"" seperated by a "";"" and focussed on taxonomic groups should be noted in the column ""Focus"" seperated by a "";""."

For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa.  Set to NA for all entries were no species were specifically focussed on."
Excluded,String,String,"If Station_objective = Incomplete and certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which taxa were excluded, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa. With exclusion we mean that there is no informtion at all noted about these taxa. For example, if a taxon was not counted but it was bulk measured the information is still usefull for presence/absence and biomass plots. Therefore, it should not be considered 'excluded'. Set to NA if there were no excluded taxa."
