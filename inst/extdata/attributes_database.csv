StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,String,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match stations metadata to species observations. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
valid_name,Taxon,String,"The taxonomic name assigned to the reported species/taxon name in the original species CSV files by checking against the accepted names in the WoRMS database. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur, because all taxa that could not be matched against WoRMS are discarded from the database."
File,File name,String,The file name of the original input CSV file from which the species data is imported. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur.
rank,Taxonomic rank,String,"The rank of the valid_name as assigned by checking against the WoRMS database. Possible ranks of the valid_name is: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
phylum,Taxonomic rank,String,The phylum that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than phylum (like kingdom) which is very unlikely.
class,Taxonomic rank,String,The class that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than class.
order,Taxonomic rank,String,The order that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than order.
family,Taxonomic rank,String,The family that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than family.

isQuantitative,1 or 0,Boolean,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Station_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete",String,"Sometimes a cruise or sampling station has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track specify: If the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Station_objective = Complete. If some groups were specifically excluded or focussed on i.e. not the full catch was processed, Station_objective = Incomplete. In this case the excluded taxonomic groups should be noted in the column ""Excluded"" seperated by a "";"" and focussed on taxonomic groups should be noted in the column ""Focus"" seperated by a "";""."
Excluded,String,String,"If Station_objective = Incomplete and certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which taxa were excluded, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa. With exclusion we mean that there is no informtion at all noted about these taxa. For example, if a taxon was not counted but it was bulk measured the information is still usefull for presence/absence and biomass plots. Therefore, it should not be considered 'excluded'. Set to NA if there were no excluded taxa."
Focus,NA,String,"If Station_objective = Incomplete and some groups were specifically focussed on, this column should be filled with the names of taxonomic groups which were the focus of this specific sampling station, seperated by "";"".
