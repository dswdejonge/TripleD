Attribute,Unit,Datatype,Description
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,String,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match stations metadata to species observations. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
valid_name,Taxon,String,"The taxonomic name assigned to the reported species/taxon name in the original species CSV files by checking against the accepted names in the WoRMS database. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur, because all taxa that could not be matched against WoRMS are discarded from the database."
File,File name,String,The file name of the original input CSV file from which the species data is imported. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur.
rank,Taxonomic rank,String,"The rank of the valid_name as assigned by checking against the WoRMS database. Possible ranks of the valid_name is: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum. No empty (i.e. NA) cells should occur."
phylum,Taxonomic rank,String,The phylum that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than phylum (like kingdom) which is very unlikely.
class,Taxonomic rank,String,The class that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than class.
order,Taxonomic rank,String,The order that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than order.
family,Taxonomic rank,String,The family that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than family.
genus,Taxonomic rank,String,The genus that belongs to the taxon under valid_name. Will only be NA if the valid_name has a rank higher than genus.
isFuzzy,1 or 0,Boolean,If the valid_name was obtained from WoRMS using an algorithm that searches for fuzzy matches (i.e. allows misspellings and phonetic spellings) isFuzzy is 1. If the match was exact is Fuzzy will be 0 or NA. This value represents 100% of the catch (so the value is corrected for any reported fraction in the original CSV files). This value is NOT corrected for sample size of the track.
source_Biomass_g,NA,String,The original column name where the biomass value was taken from. AFDW_sum = the reported biomass was measured in the lab (high confidence). AFDW_from_WW_sum = the reported biomass was converted from measured wet weight using a conversion factor in the bioconversion.csv file (medium confidence). AFDW_calc_sum = the reported biomass obtain using a regression formula from the bioconversion.csv file (low confidence).
Vessel,NA,String,Name of the research vessel. Often used: RV Pelagia.
CruiseID,NA,String,"Cruise ID when the sampling occurred, for example 64PE438. If the cruise also had a name it can optionally be provided in the attribute Cruise_name."
Station_name,NA,String,"Generic name of the station where the sample is taken, can be used to later link back to for example box core samples. DO NOT CONFUSE with StationID."
Date,DD/MM/YYYY,Date,"The date when the sampling event took place in the format ""DD/MM/YYYY"". For example: 12/01/1994. Should be based on the time in UTC+0."
Time_start,HH:MM:SS,Time,"Time in UTC+0 when the dredge touched bottom or when the sampling started. Format: HH:MM:SS. If only one moment in time is recorded, use this column; leave out Time_stop or set to NA."
Time_stop,HH:MM:SS,Time,Time in UTC+0 when the dredge was heaved from the bottom or when sampling stopped. Format: HH:MM:SS.
Blade_depth_cm,Centimeters,Double,The depth in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
Blade_width_cm,Centimeters,Double,The width in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
isQuantitative,1 or 0,Boolean,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Cruise_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete, Focus",String,"Sometimes a cruise has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track specify: If the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Cruise_objective = Complete. If  the full catch was IDed and processed except for some group(s) Cruise_objective = Incomplete. In this case note the excluded taxonomic groups in the column ""Excluded"" seperated by a "";"". If the cruise was specifically targetting a certain group(s) and therefore neglected the majority of other taxa Cruise_objective = Focus. In this case note the taxonomic groups that was focussed on in the column ""Focus"" seperated by a "";""."
Excluded,String,String,"If Cruise_focus = Incomplete, thus certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which taxa were excluded, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa. With exclusion we mean that there is no informtion at all noted about these taxa. For example, if a taxon was not counted but it was bulk measured the information is still usefull for presence/absence and biomass plots. Therefore, it should not be considered 'excluded'. Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Focus,NA,String,"If Cruise_focus = Focus this column should be filled with the names of taxonomic groups which were the focus of this specific cruise, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa.  Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Cruise_name,NA,String,"Generic name of the cruise, for example NICO10 or Normomap."
Region,"Predefined: BB, BC, CB, DB, DH, FF, OG",String,"Predefined general region where the sample is taken. If the station was not in these predefined regions, insert NA. BB = Brown Bank, BC = Botney Cut, CB = Cleaver Bank, DB = Dogger Bank, DH = Devil's Hole, FF = Frysian Front, OG = Oyster Grounds."
