Attribute,Unit,Required_or_Optional,Group,Datatype,Description
Taxon,NA,Required,NA,String,The taxon for which conversion data is provided.
WW_to_AFDW,Fraction,Optional,1,Double,The fraction with which to multiply wet weight to estimate ash-free dry weight (so NOT simply dry weight).
Reference_WW_to_AFDW,NA,Optional,1,String,The reference for the  WW to AFDW conversion factor.
Comment_WW_to_AFDW,NA,Optional,1,String,Comment related to the WW to AFDW conversion factor.
Size_dimension,"Predefined: Length, Width, Siphon, Cheliped_length, Cheliped_width, Carapace_length, Heigth, Area, Arm, Disc",Optional,2,String,The morphological part of the organism that is measured and should be used as INPUT for the corresponding regression formula (Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. These size dimensions names must correspond to the names on the diagram that visualizes the measured morphologies AND to the size dimension names from the species attributes file. Multiple regression formulas based on different morphological dimensions can be included for a single species (e.g. regression formulas for both total length and carapace length as input).
Size_unit,Predefined: mm,Optional,2,String,"The size unit on which the regression formula is based must ALWAYS be mm. This means that if you have a regression formula based on length in cm, you must first mathematically rewrite the regression formula so that mm in stead of cm can be used as input."
A_factor,NA,Optional,2,Double,"The regression formula to go from size (mm) to biomass (g) is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g, the value for measured size must always be in mm. If your regression formula does not fit this requirement, it can often be mathematically rewritten to fit this form anyway. This column contains the A_factor of the regression formula of the corresponding taxon."
B_exponent,NA,Optional,2,Double,"The regression formula to go from size (mm) to biomass (g) is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g, the value for measured size must always be in mm. If your regression formula does not fit this requirement, it can often be mathematically rewritten to fit this form anyway. This column contains the B_exponent of the regression formula of the corresponding taxon."
Output_unit,"Predefined: AFDW_g, WW_g",Optional,2,String,The regression formula to go from size to biomass is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g.
Reference_regression,NA,Optional,2,String,The reference for the regression formula.
Comment_regression,NA,Optional,2,String,"Any comments about the conversion data. If you have rewritten your regression formula in order to fit the requirements, you can write specifics here."
isShellRemoved,Boolean,Required,NA,Boolean,"If the wet weight (either the wet weight of the conversion factor WW_to_AFDW or the WW_g as output of the regression formula) concerns a wet weight EXCLUDING shell, this boolean isShellRemoved must be set to 1. In all other cases it can be set to 0. Care must be taken that both the conversion factor and regression concern the same type of wet weight, i.e. both wet weight with or without shell."
