Attribute,Unit,Required_or_Optional,Group,Datatype,Description
Taxon,NA,Required,NA,String,"The taxon for which conversion data to go from size to biomass is provided in the corresponding entry. Preferably to species level (Genus species), but this may also be a higher taxonomic level."
Size_dimension,"Predefined: Length, Width, Siphon, Cheliped_length, Cheliped_width, Carapace_length, Heigth, Area",Required,NA,String,"The morphological part of the organism that is measured and should be used as INPUT for the corresponding regression formula (Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. These measured dimensions must correspond to the diagram of general animal morphologies and the corresponding names as included in the vignette. The predefined dimensions correspond to the predefined dimensions in the species attributes. Therefore, multiple regression formulas based on different morphological dimensions can be included for a single species (e.g. regression formulas for both total length and carapace length as input)."
Size_unit,mm,Required,NA,String,"The size unit on which the regression formula is based must ALWAYS be mm. This means that if you have a regression formula based on length in cm, you must first mathematically rewrite the regression formula so that mm in stead of cm can be used as input."
WW_to_AFDW,Fraction,Required,NA,Double,The fraction with which to multiply wet weight to estimate ash-free dry weight (so NOT simply dry weight).
Reference_conversion_WW_AFDW,NA,Required,NA,String,The reference for the  WW to AFDW conversion factor.
A_factor,NA,Required,NA,Double,"The regression formula to go from size to biomass is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g, the value for measured size must always be in mm. If your regression formula does not fit this requirement, it can often be mathematically rewritten to fit this form anyway. This column contains the A_factor of the regression formula of the corresponding taxon."
B_exponent,NA,Required,NA,Double,"The regression formula to go from size to biomass is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g, the value for measured size must always be in mm. If your regression formula does not fit this requirement, it can often be mathematically rewritten to fit this form anyway. This column contains the B_exponent of the regression formula of the corresponding taxon."
Output_unit,"Predefined: AFDW_g, WW_g",Required,NA,String,The regression formula to go from size to biomass is assumed to be a power formula in the form: Output_unit = A_factor * Size_dimension_in_mm ^ B_exponent. The output unit can either be AFDW_g or WW_g.
Reference_regression,NA,Required,NA,String,The reference for the regression formula.
Comment,NA,Optional,NA,String,"Any comments about the conversion data. If you have rewritten your regression formula in order to fit the requirements, you can write specifics here."
