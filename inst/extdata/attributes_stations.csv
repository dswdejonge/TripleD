Lat_DD_midpt,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,2,"Closest approximation possible of the latitude of the midpoint of the dredge track. Alternative for start and stop coordinates.

Lon_DD_midpt,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,2,"Closest approximation possible of the longitude of the midpoint of the dredge track. Alternative for start and stop coordinates. To understand how track midpoints were determined by the respective researchers, please read the documentation in the vignette 'cleaning data'. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted)."

Blade_depth_cm,Centimeters,Double,Required,NA,The depth in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
Blade_width_cm,Centimeters,Double,Required,NA,The width in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
isQuantitative,1 or 0,Boolean,Required,NA,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Cruise_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete, Focus",String,Required,NA,Sometimes a cruise has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track: if the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Cruise_objective = Complete; if  the full catch was IDed and processed except for some group(s) Cruise_objective = Incomplete; if the cruise was specifically targetting a certain group(s) and therefore neglected the majority of other taxa Cruise_objective = Focus.
Excluded,"Predefined: F, S, P, O",String,Optional,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Incomplete, thus certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which groups were excluded. This can be any combinations of the predefined letters. F = fish were excluded, S = swimming invertebrates were excluded, P = polychaetes were excluded, O = other group was excluded."
Other_focus,NA,String,Optional,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Focus or if Excluded includes O (for Other) this column should be filled. It should either contain the names of taxonomic groups which were the focus of this specific cruise, or the names of taxonomic groups that were excluded in the process."
Vessel,NA,String,Optional,NA,Name of the research vessel. Often used: RV Pelagia.
Cruise_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Generic name of the cruise, for example NICO10 or Normomap."
Station_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Generic name of the station where the sample is taken, can be used to later link back to for example box core samples. DO NOT CONFUSE with StationID."
Region,"Predefined: BB, BC, CB, DB, DH, FF, OG",String,Optional,NA,"Predefined general region where the sample is taken. If the station was not in these predefined regions, insert NA. BB = Brown Bank, BC = Botney Cut, CB = Cleaver Bank, DB = Dogger Bank, DH = Devil's Hole, FF = Frysian Front, OG = Oyster Grounds."
Time_start,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,3,Time in UTC+0 when the dredge touched bottom or when the sampling started. Format: HH:MM:SS.
Time_stop,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,3,Time in UTC+0 when the dredge was heaved from the bottom or when sampling stopped. Format: HH:MM:SS.
Bearing,Decimal degrees,Double,Optional,NA,The bearing of the vessel while steaming the transect in decimal degrees (0 is North). Can also be calculated from start and stop coordinates if present.
Tow_speed_knots,Knots,Double,Optional,NA,The average speed at which the TripleD was towed in knots (one nautical mile per hour).
Water_depth_start_m,Meters,Double,Optional,4,Water depth in meters at the start of the sampling track (blade in sediment) as measured during the cruise.

Pre_track_distance_m,Meters,Double,Optional,NA,The distance travelled by the TripleD before the start of the actual sampling track. Used to determine the stability of the dredge in terms of bottom contact before starting the actual sampling procedure.

Quality,"Predefined: Good, Failed, Doubt",String,Optional,NA,"Predefined qualitative description of the quality of the dredge. Good = successful dredge track, Failed = unsuccessful sample, Doubt = unknown if correct sampling was fully achieved."
