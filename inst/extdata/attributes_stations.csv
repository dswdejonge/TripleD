IGNORE,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When constructing the CSV files with 1) all species and 2) all stations information, please also provide a file called ""<year>_<CruiseID>_README.txt. This textfile should function as a sort of log file, where you describe how the information was collected on this particular. Specifically, if you had to alter your original data in order to meet the requirements specified in these attributes files, provide a detailed description of how you did this. For example, the coordinate system in which you recorded your sample points did not correspond to the coordinate system assumed in the TripleD package. Therefore, you converted the coordinates from the one system to the other using a specific R-function. This should be reported in the readme file: what was the original coordinate system, and what method was employed to convert it to the required coordinate system? This readme will allow future users of the data to understand how the collection of data changed over time. (Note: this row is ignored by the TripleD package and is only to notify you of the need for a readme file.) Check list for readme file: Your name; the date you latest updated the CSV file; what cruise this readme file belongs to; which raw data files you have used and perhaps where one could find those data; any general remarks about the cruise or data; for the stations CSV how each column was filled incl. any assumptions, calculations, conversions, and code; for the species CSV how each column was filled incl. any assumptions, calculations, conversions, and code."
CruiseID,NA,Required,String,NA,"Cruise ID when the sampling occurred, for example 64PE438. If the cruise also had a name it can optionally be provided in the attribute Cruise_name."
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,Required,String,NA,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match stations metadata to species observations."

The coordinate system should be WGS84 (aka EPSG:4326) (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted).
Lat_DD_midpt,Decimal degrees in WGS84 (aka EPSG:4326),Required_alternative,Double,2,"Closest approximation possible of the latitude of the midpoint of the dredge track. Alternative for start and stop coordinates. To understand how track midpoints were determined by the respective researchers, please read the documentation in the vignette 'cleaning data'.

The coordinate system should be WGS84 (aka EPSG:4326) (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted)."
Track_length_m_preset,Meters,Required_alternative,Double,2,"The preset track length that was used (often a round value, e.g. 100 or 50 m). Alternative for start and stop coordinates of the track, which are often logged with USBL. On basis of tests and comparisons we know that the portside odometer wheel gives a reliable estimate to check if the preset track length was indeed dredged. The number of ticks from the odometer is recorded in the column 'Odometer_count'. A comparison between preset track lengths and USBL derived trackl lengths showed that with a preset track length of 100 m, the exact track length was 99.8±5.5 meter (info from Rob Witbaard). So, preset track length is quite reliable."
Blade_depth_cm,Centimeters,Required,Double,NA,"The depth in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade. However, the exact depth varies somewhat with sediment type, thus it should be interpreted as anticipated track depth."
Blade_width_cm,Centimeters,Required,Double,NA,"The width in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade. However, the exact width of the exised strip may vary somewhat, e.g. when the dredge is not completely level over the sediment. Hence, it should be interpreted as anticipated track width."
is_Quantitative,1 or 0,Required,Boolean,NA,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Station_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete, Focus",Required,String,NA,"Sometimes a cruise has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track specify: If the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Cruise_objective = Complete. If  the full catch was IDed and processed except for some group(s) Cruise_objective = Incomplete. In this case note the excluded taxonomic groups in the column ""Excluded"" seperated by a "";"". If the cruise was specifically targetting a certain group(s) and therefore neglected the majority of other taxa Cruise_objective = Focus. In this case note the taxonomic groups that was focussed on in the column ""Focus"" seperated by a "";""."
Excluded,String,Optional,String,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Incomplete, thus certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which taxa were excluded, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa. With exclusion we mean that there is no informtion at all noted about these taxa. For example, if a taxon was not counted but it was bulk measured the information is still usefull for presence/absence and biomass plots. Therefore, it should not be considered 'excluded'. Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Focus,NA,Optional,String,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Focus this column should be filled with the names of taxonomic groups which were the focus of this specific cruise, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa.  Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Vessel,NA,Optional,String,NA,Name of the research vessel. Often used: RV Pelagia.

Region,"Predefined: BB, BC, CB, DB, DH, FF, FG, OG",Optional,String,NA,"Predefined general region where the sample is taken. If the station was not in these predefined regions, insert NA. BB = Brown Bank, BC = Botney Cut, CB = Cleaver Bank, DB = Dogger Bank, DH = Devil's Hole, FF = Frysian Front, FG = Fladen Grounds, OG = Oyster Grounds."
Time_start,HH:MM:SS,Optional,Time,NA,"Time in UTC+0 when the dredge touched bottom or when the sampling started. Format: HH:MM:SS. If only one moment in time is recorded, use this column; leave out Time_stop or set to NA."
Time_stop,HH:MM:SS,Optional,Time,NA,Time in UTC+0 when the dredge was heaved from the bottom or when sampling stopped. Format: HH:MM:SS.
Bearing,Decimal degrees,Optional,Double,NA,"A measure for the general direction of the dredged track. Is reported as an angle in respect to the north (0):  -0 to -180 is the angle westward/left from the north, and +0 to +180 is the angle eastwards/right from the north. Can for example be estimated from the initial bearing between two points, or the bearing of the vessel while steaming the transect. If start and stop coordinates of the track are given, the bearing can later be calculated."
