Cruise_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Name of the cruise, for example NICO10 or Normomap."
Station_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Generic name of the station where the sample is taken, can be used to later link back to for example box core samples. DO NOT CONFUSE with StationID."
Region,"Predefined: BC, CB, DB, DH, FF",String,Optional,NA,"Predefined general region where the sample is taken. If the station was not in these predefined regions, insert NA. BC = Botney Cut, CB = Cleaver Bank, DB = Dogger Bank, DH = Devil's Hole, FF = Frysian Front"
Time_start,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,3,Time when the dredge touched bottom. Format: HH:MM:SS
Time_stop,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,3,Time when the dredge was heaved from the bottom. Format: HH:MM:SS

Water_depth_m,Meters,Double,Optional,NA,Average water depth at the dredge track as measured during the cruise.
Pre_track_distance_m,Meters,Double,Optional,NA,The dredge length before the start of the actual track. Used to determine the stability of the dredge in terms of bottom contact before starting the actual sampling procedure.
Cable_length_m,Meters,Double,Optional,NA,Length of cable veered from ship to the dredge.
SB_count,Count,Integer,Optional,NA,"Measure to check the pre-track + track distance, where each counted tick equals 2 m."
