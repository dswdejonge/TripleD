Attribute,Unit,Datatype,Required_or_Optional,Group,Description
CruiseID,NA,String,Required,NA,"Cruise ID when the sampling occurred, for example 64PE438. If the cruise also had a name it can optionally be provided in the attribute Cruise_name."
StationID,<cruiseID/cruise name>#<station/event number>,String,Required,NA,"A unique ID for the sampling event, preferably as ""<cruiseID>#<station/event number>"". For example: 64PE438#21. Very important because it is used to match stations metadata to species observations."
Date,DD/MM/YYYY,Date,Required,NA,"The date when the sampling event took place in the format ""DD/MM/YYYY"". For example: 12/01/1994. Should be based on the time in UTC+0."
Lat_start_DD,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,1,Latitude of the dredge when the blade entered the sediment and started sampling. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted).
Lon_start_DD,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,1,Longitude of the dredge when the blade entered the sediment and started sampling. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted).
Lat_stop_DD,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,1,Latitude of the dredge when the blade was retracted from the sediment and stopped sampling. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted).
Lon_stop_DD,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,1,Longitude of the dredge when the blade was retracted from the sediment and stopped sampling. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted).
Lat_DD_midpt,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,2,"Closest approximation possible of the latitude of the midpoint of the dredge track. Alternative for start and stop coordinates. To understand how track midpoints were determined by the respective researchers, please read the documentation in the vignette 'cleaning data'. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted)."
Lon_DD_midpt,Decimal degrees in WGS84,Double,Required_alternative,2,"Closest approximation possible of the longitude of the midpoint of the dredge track. Alternative for start and stop coordinates. To understand how track midpoints were determined by the respective researchers, please read the documentation in the vignette 'cleaning data'. The coordinate system should be WGS84 (so data from other coordinate systems like ED50 should first be converted)."
Track_length_m_cruise,Meters,Double,Required_alternative,2,"Track length as determined during the cruise. Alternative for start and stop coordinates. To understand how track length was determined by the respective researchers, please read the documentation in the vignette 'cleaning_data'."
Blade_depth_cm,Centimeters,Double,Required,NA,The depth in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
Blade_width_cm,Centimeters,Double,Required,NA,The width in cm of the exised strip of sediment by the blade.
isQuantitative,1 or 0,Boolean,Required,NA,"For each sampling track it should be noted if the catch can be used fully quantitatively (isQuantitative = 1) or not (isQuantitative = 0). For example, if there are doubts about if the catch correctly represents the full area sampled track but the data might still be useful to analyze the abundance of species relative to each other, the data can be included while setting the isQuantitative to 0."
Cruise_objective,"Predefined: Complete, Incomplete, Focus",String,Required,NA,"Sometimes a cruise has a specific focus on a taxonomic group or a certain taxonomic group is explicitally excluded. For every track specify: If the full catch was IDed and processed (so no focus or exclusions) Cruise_objective = Complete. If  the full catch was IDed and processed except for some group(s) Cruise_objective = Incomplete. In this case note the excluded taxonomic groups in the column ""Excluded"" seperated by a "";"". If the cruise was specifically targetting a certain group(s) and therefore neglected the majority of other taxa Cruise_objective = Focus. In this case note the taxonomic groups that was focussed on in the column ""Focus"" seperated by a "";""."
Excluded,String,String,Optional,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Incomplete, thus certain groups were not IDed and processed, this column should specify which taxa were excluded, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa. With exclusion we mean that there is no informtion at all noted about these taxa. For example, if a taxon was not counted but it was bulk measured the information is still usefull for presence/absence and biomass plots. Therefore, it should not be considered 'excluded'. Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Focus,NA,String,Optional,NA,"If Cruise_focus = Focus this column should be filled with the names of taxonomic groups which were the focus of this specific cruise, seperated by "";"". For example: Polychaeta;Callianassa.  Set to NA for all entries that were completely processed (Cruise_focus = Complete)."
Vessel,NA,String,Optional,NA,Name of the research vessel. Often used: RV Pelagia.
Cruise_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Generic name of the cruise, for example NICO10 or Normomap."
Station_name,NA,String,Optional,NA,"Generic name of the station where the sample is taken, can be used to later link back to for example box core samples. DO NOT CONFUSE with StationID."
Region,"Predefined: BB, BC, CB, DB, DH, FF, OG",String,Optional,NA,"Predefined general region where the sample is taken. If the station was not in these predefined regions, insert NA. BB = Brown Bank, BC = Botney Cut, CB = Cleaver Bank, DB = Dogger Bank, DH = Devil's Hole, FF = Frysian Front, OG = Oyster Grounds."
Time_start,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,NA,"Time in UTC+0 when the dredge touched bottom or when the sampling started. Format: HH:MM:SS. If only one moment in time is recorded, use this column; leave out Time_stop or set to NA."
Time_stop,HH:MM:SS,Time,Optional,NA,Time in UTC+0 when the dredge was heaved from the bottom or when sampling stopped. Format: HH:MM:SS.
Bearing,Decimal degrees,Double,Optional,NA,The bearing of the vessel while steaming the transect in decimal degrees (0 is North). Can also be calculated from start and stop coordinates if present.
Tow_speed_knots,Knots,Double,Optional,NA,The average speed at which the TripleD was towed in knots (one nautical mile per hour).
Water_depth_m_cruise,Meters,Double,Optional,NA,Average water depth in meters at the sampling track as measured during the cruise.
Odometer_count,Count,Integer,Optional,NA,"Measure to check the track distance, where each counted tick equals 2 m."
Comment,NA,String,Optional,NA,Any comments about the sampling station / track.
