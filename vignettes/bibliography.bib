abstract = {Grabs and corers are commonly used to estimate densities of infauna species quantitatively. However, because of the limited sample size, such instruments are not practicable for sampling species of low abundance. With trawls and dredges samples of much larger sizes can be obtained, but the existing types of gear are, at best, semi-quantitative for catching infauna. In this paper a prototype dredge is introduced for quantitative sampling of larger-size ({\textgreater} 10 mm) infauna of low abundance. This 'Deep Digging Dredge' (Triple-D) is rigged with an interchangeable blade to collect a strip of the seabed. During the haul, several hundred metres long, the excavated sediment is sieved through a net with a 1.4 cm stretched mesh size. The prototype was successfully tested on infauna in fine-grained adhesive sediments in the Wadden Sea, using a 20-cm-wide blade with a penetration depth into the sediment of 10 cm. In field studies on soft and sandy bottoms in the North Sea, the Triple-D estimated the densities of some epifauna and flatfish species higher than a fine-meshed beamtrawl. {\textcopyright} 1994.},
