abstract = {Grabs and corers are commonly used to estimate densities of infauna species quantitatively. However, because of the limited sample size, such instruments are not practicable for sampling species of low abundance. With trawls and dredges samples of much larger sizes can be obtained, but the existing types of gear are, at best, semi-quantitative for catching infauna. In this paper a prototype dredge is introduced for quantitative sampling of larger-size ({\textgreater} 10 mm) infauna of low abundance. This 'Deep Digging Dredge' (Triple-D) is rigged with an interchangeable blade to collect a strip of the seabed. During the haul, several hundred metres long, the excavated sediment is sieved through a net with a 1.4 cm stretched mesh size. The prototype was successfully tested on infauna in fine-grained adhesive sediments in the Wadden Sea, using a 20-cm-wide blade with a penetration depth into the sediment of 10 cm. In field studies on soft and sandy bottoms in the North Sea, the Triple-D estimated the densities of some epifauna and flatfish species higher than a fine-meshed beamtrawl. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {We introduce a global data bank on body composition of aquatic organisms that is available at http://www.thomas-brey.de/science/virtualhandbook. It covers ratios between body mass (wet, dry, ash free dry mass), body composition (protein, lipid, carbohydrate), macro-elements (C, N, P) and energy content (J). Sofar, data for 3158 different taxa (animals, plants, bacteria) were collected from 725 different sources. The principal purpose of the data bank is mining for conversion factors, as necessary in ecological studies that require a common energetic currency. The data bank can be used to explore general ecological principles, too: among all animals, carnivorous swimmers have the highest energy density, presumably an across-taxon selection for propulsion power and handling force. Plants and animals do not only differ in their C/N and C/P ratios, but these ratios change with temperature in opposite directions. In plants, C/N and C/P increase with temperature, most likely a response to the higher levels of N and P in polar waters. In animals C/N and C/P decrease with temperature, an indicator for selection towards lower activity and larger lipid stores in polar animals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Size-based analyses of marine animals are increasingly used to improve understanding of community structure and function. However, the resources required to record individual body weights for benthic animals, where the number of individuals can reach several thousand in a square metre, are often prohibitive. Here we present morphometric (length-weight) relationships for 216 benthic species from the North Sea to permit weight estimation from length measurements. These relationships were calculated using data collected over two years from 283 stations. For ten abundant and widely dispersed species we tested for significant spatial and temporal differences in morphometric relationships. Some were found, but the magnitude of differences was small in relation to the size-ranges of animals that are usually present and we recommend that the regression relationships given here, based on pooled data, are appropriate for most types of population and community analyses. Our hope is that the availability of these morphometric relationships will encourage the more frequent application of size-based analyses to benthic survey data, and so enhance understanding of the ecology of the benthic/demersal component of marine ecosystems and food webs.

@article{Eklof2017,
abstract = {Background. Organism biomass is one of the most important variables in ecological studies, making biomass estimations one of the most common laboratory tasks. Biomass of small macroinvertebrates is usually estimated as dry mass or ash-free dry mass (hereafter `DM' vs. `AFDM') per sample; a laborious and time consuming process, that often can be speeded up using easily measured and reliable proxy variables like body size or wet (fresh) mass. Another common way of estimating AFDM (one of the most accurate but also time-consuming estimates of biologically active tissue mass) is the use of AFDM/DM ratios as conversion factors. So far, however, these ratios typically ignore the possibility that the relative mass of biologically active vs. non-active support tissue (e.g., protective exoskeleton or shell)-and therefore, also AFDM/DM ratios-may change with body size, as previously shown for taxa like spiders, vertebrates and trees. Methods. We collected aquatic, epibenthic macroinvertebrates ({\textgreater}1 mm) in 32 shallow bays along a 360 km stretch of the Swedish coast along the Baltic Sea; one of the largest brackish water bodies on Earth. We then estimated statistical relationships between the body size (length or height in mm), body dry mass and ash-free dry mass for 14 of the most common taxa; five gastropods, three bivalves, three crustaceans and three insect larvae. Finally, we statistically estimated the potential influence of body size on the AFDM/DM ratio per taxon. Results. For most taxa, non-linear regression models describing the power relationship between body size and (i)DMand (ii)AFDMfit the data well (as indicated by low SE and high R2). Moreover, for more than half of the taxa studied (including the vast majority of the shelled molluscs), body size had a negative influence on organism AFDM/DM ratios. Discussion. The good fit of the modelled power relationships suggests that the constants reported here can be used to quickly estimate organism dry- and ash-free dry mass based on body size, thereby freeing up considerable work resources. However, the considerable differences in constants between taxa emphasize the need for taxonspecific relationships, and the potential dangers associated with ignoring body size. The negative influence of body size on the AFDM/DM ratio found in a majority of the molluscs could be caused by increasingly thicker shells with organism age, and/or spawning-induced loss of biologically active tissue in adults. Consequently, future studies utilizing AFDM/DM (and presumably also AFDM/wet mass) ratios should carefully assess the potential influence of body size to ensure more reliable estimates of organism body mass.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The spatial distribution of the tubicolous polychaete {\textless}i{\textgreater}Owenia fusiformis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} Delle Chiaje in the Bay of Blanes was studied during summer 1996. Populations were located on sandy sediments and a heterogeneous distribution of specimens was found. Three areas with different densities were observed: the vicinity of the harbour, the mouth of the Tordera River, and the open bay. Although adult individuals were present all over the bay at low densities, large numbers were mainly found near the harbour. Differences in mean individual biomass were also observed among stations. The largest individuals were found at the mouth of the river, where the fluxes of suspended matter were maximal. Juveniles of {\textless}i{\textgreater}O. fusiformis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} also showed a regular pattern of spatial variation along the bay. The highest density of juveniles was found in the area where high densities of adults occurred. The consequences of this spatial variability were analyzed in relation to the effect of sediment grain size on 3 successive processes of recruitment (metamorphosis, juvenile transformation and tube construction) in running still-water experiments. The influence of sediment particle size on the disappearance of larvae in the 3 processes was analyzed. The large grain size of the substratum had a significant negative effect on the construction of {\textless}i{\textgreater}O. fusiformis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} tubes. After settlement, {\textless}i{\textgreater}O. fusiformis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} needs a high percentage of fine sediment to construct the tube. Our results support the hypothesis that the spatial distribution pattern of the species in the field is influenced by sediment particle size. The importance of the presence of {\textless}i{\textgreater}O. fusiformis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} adult tubes and seagrass shoots in stabilizing the sediments, and thus determining the pattern, is also discussed. },

abstract = {Length-mass relationships are potentially useful tools to estimate individual biomass, assuming a relative invariance within and among populations and, sometimes, among species pertaining to a same family or order. Here, we present a field test of these assumptions in guilds of benthic macroinvertebrates colonising transitional water ecosystems. To this aim, we are analysing length-mass relationships of benthic macroinvertebrates of transitional water ecosystems and assessing their variability among populations of a same species and among species of a same family and/or order. Data are from synoptic studies carried out at four oligohaline transitional water ecosystems, from the Southern Italy and the Danube delta ecoregions; they refer to 40 macroinvertebrate taxa selected from the overall species pool according to absolute and relative density requirements. Species composition differed widely among ecoregions while length-mass relationships of the species occurring in both ecoregions did not; the variability of length-mass parameters of these species among ecosystems was lower than 10{\%}. Length-mass regressions were relatively conservative also with respect to taxonomic resolution; significant differences were observed among species within 5 out of the 7 orders tested but differences in slopes and intercepts were on average lower than 15{\%}. Therefore, our results, representing one of the first efforts to catalogue length-mass relationships for benthic macroinvertebrates in transitional waters, support the assumption of relative invariance of length-mass relationships and their use in studies where gross estimates of population biomasses are required. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
