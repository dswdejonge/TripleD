abstract = {Grabs and corers are commonly used to estimate densities of infauna species quantitatively. However, because of the limited sample size, such instruments are not practicable for sampling species of low abundance. With trawls and dredges samples of much larger sizes can be obtained, but the existing types of gear are, at best, semi-quantitative for catching infauna. In this paper a prototype dredge is introduced for quantitative sampling of larger-size ({\textgreater} 10 mm) infauna of low abundance. This 'Deep Digging Dredge' (Triple-D) is rigged with an interchangeable blade to collect a strip of the seabed. During the haul, several hundred metres long, the excavated sediment is sieved through a net with a 1.4 cm stretched mesh size. The prototype was successfully tested on infauna in fine-grained adhesive sediments in the Wadden Sea, using a 20-cm-wide blade with a penetration depth into the sediment of 10 cm. In field studies on soft and sandy bottoms in the North Sea, the Triple-D estimated the densities of some epifauna and flatfish species higher than a fine-meshed beamtrawl. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Brey2010,
abstract = {We introduce a global data bank on body composition of aquatic organisms that is available at http://www.thomas-brey.de/science/virtualhandbook. It covers ratios between body mass (wet, dry, ash free dry mass), body composition (protein, lipid, carbohydrate), macro-elements (C, N, P) and energy content (J). Sofar, data for 3158 different taxa (animals, plants, bacteria) were collected from 725 different sources. The principal purpose of the data bank is mining for conversion factors, as necessary in ecological studies that require a common energetic currency. The data bank can be used to explore general ecological principles, too: among all animals, carnivorous swimmers have the highest energy density, presumably an across-taxon selection for propulsion power and handling force. Plants and animals do not only differ in their C/N and C/P ratios, but these ratios change with temperature in opposite directions. In plants, C/N and C/P increase with temperature, most likely a response to the higher levels of N and P in polar waters. In animals C/N and C/P decrease with temperature, an indicator for selection towards lower activity and larger lipid stores in polar animals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Robinson2010,
abstract = {Size-based analyses of marine animals are increasingly used to improve understanding of community structure and function. However, the resources required to record individual body weights for benthic animals, where the number of individuals can reach several thousand in a square metre, are often prohibitive. Here we present morphometric (length-weight) relationships for 216 benthic species from the North Sea to permit weight estimation from length measurements. These relationships were calculated using data collected over two years from 283 stations. For ten abundant and widely dispersed species we tested for significant spatial and temporal differences in morphometric relationships. Some were found, but the magnitude of differences was small in relation to the size-ranges of animals that are usually present and we recommend that the regression relationships given here, based on pooled data, are appropriate for most types of population and community analyses. Our hope is that the availability of these morphometric relationships will encourage the more frequent application of size-based analyses to benthic survey data, and so enhance understanding of the ecology of the benthic/demersal component of marine ecosystems and food webs.
