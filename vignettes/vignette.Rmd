# Short summary
- The NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research owns a special dredge called the **Triple-D (Deep Digging Dredge)** to sample megafauna from sedimentary habitats.  
- **Time series** data collected over the years (so far only from the North Sea) are stored in CSV files (one file per research cruise) in the NIOZ Data Archiving System (DAS).  
- The goal of the TripleD package is to read the CSV files, and employ pre-written workflows to obtain a database-style table with **presence-absence, density, and biomass data** of benthic megafauna.  
- The **transparancy and elaborate documentation** allows users of the package to exactly retrace the source of data, how calculations were performed, and which assumptions underly the data in the final database.  
- This workflow also allows the user to **rewrite (part of) the workflow** to process the original data if they have specific wishes/assumptions they would like to use.  
- The output of the TripleD package can directly be used in a developed **Shiny app to visually interact with the data**.

# 1. Introduction
The Triple-D (Deep Digging Dredge) is a dredge designed by NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research that can easily sample relatively large areas of seabed to quantitatively study the distribution of megafauna that generally occurs in low abundances. So far, the Triple-D is only used in the North Sea, mostly on the Dutch Continental Shelf.  

The Triple-D was introduced in the last century and has been happily sampling every since. The data collected over the years forms a valuable time series and it was decided to more systematically archive the data to allow easier exploration of this wealth of data and easier incorporation of new data in the future. This Triple-D R-package is the result of this decision, and this vignette explains why.

The basic idea is three-fold:   

1. All original sampling data is collected in CSV files (one file per research cruise) formatted in a specific way as specified by the Triple-D package. This data is original data, meaning with as few underlying assumptions as possible. This original data - that should not be mutated - is archived in the NIOZ Data Archiving System (DAS). The data is owned by NIOZ and can be requested by potential users.     
2. The TripleD R-package can read the CSV files with original data, and processes this data using pre-written workflows to produce a single database-like table with presence-absence, density, and biomass data that can be used in ecological analyses. So, by running the package with requested CSV files you can construct a local database on your own machine. The R-package is available to everyone with completely transparent workflows and elaborate documentation. Therefore, the user is able to completely retrace all data mutations and can even re-write (part of) the workflow if (s)he wishes to produce a personal database that uses other calculations and assumptions from the default workflow.   
3. A Shiny app is developed to visually interact with the database as produced by the default workflow in the TripleD package. It allows the user to intuitively filter and browse the data in order to better grasp what data is available, and how the data can be employed for the research question at hand.   


This vignette contains background information on the Triple-D itself, explains how to use the Triple-D package, and provided guidelines how you can add new data to the Triple-D data archive.

# 2. The Triple-D: Deep Digging Dredge
## 2.A. Description
A prototype of the Triple-D was introduced by Bergman & Santbrink [@Bergman1994]. It was developed in order to better quantitatively study the distribution of generally sparsly abundant megafauna. The prototype Triple-D was 2.0 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1.5 m high and weighted about 600 kg. The current Triple-D is 2.4 m long, 2.6 m wide, 1.2 m high and weights about 1200 kg. The dredge contains a blade of 20 cm width that is pushed into the sediment to a depth of 20 cm and consequently towed over the seabed at a speed of 3 knots. The tow track length is measured by an odometer (a wheel tracking the distance) set to 100 m that also controls the pneumatic opening-closing mechanism. The sediment that is exised from the seabed passes through a tailing 6 m with a mesh size of 7 mm. The remaining fauna in the net representing a total area of 20 m2 are brought aboard for identification and measurements.

## 2.B. Sampling procedure
The dredge is lowered to the seabed and towed over the sediment until it's stable (the pre-track distance). The blade is pushed into the sediment to start the actual sampling track in a certain direction (bearing). The length of this sampling track is preset, and often 100 m (especially in recent years). All sediment exised by the blade pass through a net that retains the organisms. After the intended track distance the blad is taken out of the sediment, and the catch is brought up to the ship. Based on several sources of information it is decided whether or not the sampling track was successful and can be used quantitatively.   

On board, any remaining sediment is washed from the organisms. The organisms are identified and grouped. Preferably all specimens are counted, measured, and weighed. However, due to the sometimes large number of specimens only a representative fraction of the species is measured and weighed. For example, 100 specimens of *Asterias rubens* (common sea star) are caught. Due to time constraints, 20 representative specimens are selected, measured and weighed (the other 80 are discarded). These measurements (size and weight) are noted together with a fraction of 0.2 (i.e. 20 of 100 specimens processed). This fraction is later used to upscale the measured values to an estimation for the complete catch.  

If you want to use the TripleD to collect organisms, follow these guidelines to easily convert your documented work into data for the TripleD database:  

1) For each research cruise eventually a stations CSV data file, a species CSV data file, and a readme text file should be created. Take a look at the required attributes and detailed definitions first (see 3.B.). You can even create and print a template sheet to fill in your data while working onboard.  
2) Write down the specs of the TripleD: What blade depth and width are you using? What is your net mesh size? And other important information. Document this as explained in the attributes file.  
3) Decide beforehand if you are going to process the full catch, or if you are going to ignore certain groups? Perhaps you only want to study a certain group (e.g. bivalves) and you will ignore the rest. Document this as explained in the attributes file.  
4) While sampling, keep good track of the date, time (UTC+0), and position (WGS84) of the ship and the dredge track. Preferably also document other information like tow speed, bearing, and water depth.  
5) When the TripleD is back on board, assess the confidence of the sampled track. If something appears to have gone wrong, document this. If the catch cannot be used quantitatively, but the information is usefull for presence-absence or relative abundances withint the sample, document this as explained in the attributes files.  
6) Identify and sort the catch. The process will be smoother if the full catch is properly sorted before starting the measurements. You can document who identified the species and if that identification is confident (i.e. no doubt).  
7) Preferably, each individual is measured and weighed. However, sometimes it is easier to pool some organisms together. For example, if multiple organisms have the same size, you can decide to pool and weigh them together. Report how many specimens are included in each entry (count). Egg masses, and algae batches, and other loose material that you want to document, should be reported with a count of -1. Each entry must have a unique ID. You can start assigning these onboard already. This is especially usefull when you want to store the organisms for later analysis in the lab (e.g. AFDW measurements). Make sure to consistently use this ID! Document if you will preserve certain organisms and where a user of the database may find these specimens in the future.  
7) For each taxon, measure the size of all organisms. Carefully document the size dimension measured (diagram below), the unit (mm, cm, 1/2cm [note on using 1/2cm units below]), and the value. You can also only process a fraction of the catch, document this accordingly. Below is a diagram that explains for each general morphological group what size dimensions may be measured and what unit is the most appropriate. Hanging this diagram onboard as a large A1 poster, and providing it as laminated hand-out may help your colleagues/studnets/volunteers in the process. Sticking to the defined size dimensions and documenting their names strictly as written on the diagram will ease digitizing your measurements!  
![TripleD size diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dswdejonge/TripleD/master/inst/extdata/_morphologies.png)

8) For each taxon: weigh the wet weight. You can also only process a fraction of the catch, document this accordingly. Document the threshold of the scale you are using. If the weight of a specimen is below the threshold, record 0. If the weight is not measured at all, record NA. If an organism is broken/missing body parts, write down that the wet weight is an underestimation because it only concerns a partial wet weight. If an organism naturally occurs with a hard external structure, like a shell (also hermit crabs!) or a tube (tube worms), write down if this shell was removed before weighing! If your weight does NOT concern a single entry but is a bulk weight (e.g. all specimens of a certain taxon are weighed together but measured for size seperately), document this accordingly! Eggs should generally not be included in the weight and be weighed seperately, unless it can't be avoided.  
9) If you decide to take specimens back to the lab (read point 6!) for ash-free dry weight (AFDW) measurements, also document the scale threshold, if the organisms were broken, and if the weight is a bulk weight or not. AFDW is the dry weight (drying of wet tissue in the oven) minus the weight of the ash left after combustion of the tissue, i.e. AFDW and dry weight are not equivalent. Ash-free dry weight only concerns biologically active tissue, so external hard structures like shells are always removed. Make sure you match the AFDW measurement to the right entry (use the unique entry IDs). AFDW is the measurement type used to report final biomasses in the database.  

Following these guidelines should make it easy to digitize your data as required by the TripleD package (see 3.B.).  
![half cm units](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dswdejonge/TripleD/master/inst/extdata/half_cm_units.png)

**Note on using the 1/2cm unit**:  
The unit 1/2cm is used a bit differently than the units mm and cm, because it works with ‘classes’. Imagine you have a ruler with tick-marks every 5 mm. So, the first tick mark at 0 mm, the second tick mark at 5 mm, the third tick mark at 10 mm, etc. If the organism is at least 5 mm (so between 5 and 10 mm) it falls in the class 1 ½cm. This means that an organism that is 4 mm falls in the class 0 ½ cm,and an organism of 14 mm will fall in the class 2 ½cm. Understanding this system is especially important if you want to convert ½units to mm or cm.

## 2.C. Limitations
- The blade width and blade depth dimension are the intended sampling width and depth. However due to sediment types, objects in the sediment, and unevenness of the sediment, the actual track width and depth may differ somewhat. No study is yet done to quantify these effects.  
- Polychaetes are caught by the Triple-D, but the Triple-D is not suitable for a quantitative analysis of polychaete abundance.  
- Amphiura are often broken when processed, therefore the estimated biomass are probably almost always underestimations.

# 3. The TripleD R-package

## 3.A. General structure
The Triple-D R-package and all related files can be found in its GitHub repository: github.com/dswdejonge/TripleD. The general structure of the package, and how files relate to each other, are explained in this cheatsheet:  

![TripleD package cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dswdejonge/TripleD/master/inst/extdata/cheatsheet.png)
  
## 3.B. Input files
The TripleD package can only read in CSV data files - one with sampling station data and one with species data per research cruise - that meet the specified requirements. The attribute files included in the package describe these requirements. This may require cleaning of your raw data files. A description of this cleaning process must be logged in the corresponding readme file.  

Preparation of the CSV files is best done manually: it can be the step where you carefully review the data you noted during the cruise (e.g. on paper) while you convert it to a carefully documented digital format.

General requirements:    

- Per research cruise you need three files: 1) Station data ('Year_CruiseID_stations.csv'), 2) Species data ('Year_CruiseID_species.csv'), and 3) a readme file explaining how the former two files were constructued ('Year_CruiseID_README.txt').  
- As much as possible, only include original data, i.e. measured and derived during the research cruise, and not calculated or sourced from an external dataset.  
- Fields may **never** be empty.   
- Always be aware of the difference between 'NA' (not measured) and '0' (measured and value is 0).   
- A sampling station corresponds to a single unique sampling event (i.e. dredge track), and NOT to a geographical location.   
- CruiseID, StationID, and EntryID are always required and must contain unique values. StationID is especially important because it is used to match station data to species data.  
- Do not include columns where all values are NA (otherwise R will treat them as characters in stead of missing values).    
- Following from the former statement, it is not necessary to include all columns in the attributes files. The attributes files note which columns are 'Required' (i.e. they must always be included) and which are 'Optional' (i.e. if you haven't measured this data, simply leave this column out).   
- Coordinates must be in WGS84.   
- Time must be in UTC+0.   
- Please report in English as much as possible, so that international researchers can also use the data.  

Stations CSV attributes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dswdejonge/TripleD/blob/master/inst/extdata/attributes_stations.csv), and species CSV attributes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dswdejonge/TripleD/blob/master/inst/extdata/attributes_species.csv). Alternatively, you can view the requirements in R:  
```{r view_att, eval=FALSE}
library(TripleD)
print(stations_att)
print(species_att)
```

To help guide you with constructing the CSV files according to the requirements, I have added some examples below. Don't forget to write a readme file with a log of how you constructed your CSV files!

### Example: Stations name
Entry for a cruise 64PE330 in 2017 for a project called FakeSamples. The third sampling track was within a windmill park at a fixed monitoring station called WM10.   

|CruiseID | StationID | Date       | Cruise_name     | Station_name | Region | Comment |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- | -----------     | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
|64PE330 | 64PE330#3  | 01/01/2017 | FakeSamples2017 | WM10          | WM    | Monitoring station |
  
Note that the CruiseID (required) and Cruise_name (optional) should not be confused, just like StationID (required and used to match to the species file) and Station_name (optional). The date should be in the correct format (01-01-2017 would be wrong), and the region should be a predefined abbreviation in the attributes file.

### Example: Coordinates and time
During cruise 64PE330 you sampled a station and recorded the start and stop coordinates of the track in coordinate system ED50 i.e. EPSG4230 (e.g. 5.2185, 54.329 to 5.2180, 54.322), and the local start and stop time (16.30 - 17.00 UTC+2).  
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dswdejonge/rgis")
library(rgis)
rgis::transform_latlon_to_different_CRS(data.frame(x= c(5.2185, 5.2180), 
                                                   y = c(54.329, 54.322)), 
                                        epsg_code_from = 4230, epsg_code_to = 4326)
```
  
| StationID | Lat_start_DD | Lon_start_DD | Lat_stop_DD | Lon_stop_DD | Time_start | Time_stop |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 64PE330#4 | 54.32828     | 5.217122     | 54.32128    | 5.216622    | 14:30:00   | 15:00:00  |
  
Note that the coordinates are always expected in coordinate reference system WGS84 (aka EPSG:4326), meaning that in this case the coordinates reported in ED50 (aka EPSG:4230) must first be transformed. In this case I used a function written in R hosted on GitHub, but there is also a web functionality that can be used (https://epsg.io/transform). Also note that the reported time must always have the format HH:MM:SS (so 14.30 would not be accepted) and must be reported in UTC+0, meaning in this case the time had to be converted from local time UTC+2 to UTC+0. In your readme file you should state how you converted your original data to fit the requirements of the TripleD CSV files! Finally, you should either provide start and stop coordinates of the track OR the track midpoint coordinates, i.e. at least of of them is required. You are free to add both pieces of information but it is not necessary (the TripleD package can automatically calculate track length and midpoint based on the provided start and stop coordinates).  

### Example: Sample metadata  
After retrieving the net it was found to be overfull, mostly due to Calianassa mud shrimp and Abra alba bivalves. It is decided to do another track right beside the original track, but at only half of the original track length and disregarding Calianassa and Abra alba entirely. This time the retrieved net is not overfull.  

| StationID | Track_length_m_preset | is_Quantitative | Station_objective | Excluded |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 64PE330#4 | 100                   | 0               | Complete          | NA       |
| 64PE330#5 | 50                    | 1               | Incomplete        | Calianassa;Abra alba|
  
As the first net was overfull, the catch *cannot* be used quantitatively (i.e. to calculate density or biomass per m2 or m3), however, the information is kept for e.g. studying relative abundance within this one catch. The second track was much shorter, and therefore the catch *can* be used quantitatively. However, during later ecological analysis it must be taken into account Calianassa and Abra alba were excluded in processing the catch (i.e. the lack of those species in this specific sample does not mean they weren't present). Note that the species in the column 'Excluded' are seperated with a ';'.  

### Example: Water depth
You lost the notes with water depth for some stations measured during the research cruise. However, you do have a  bathymetric map with water depths on which you can find depths based on the coordinates.  

| StationID | Water_depth_m_cruise | Comment |
| --------- | ---------------------| ------- |
| 64PE330#4 | 32                   | NA      |
| 64PE330#5 | NA                   | Water depth notes lost |
| 64PE330#6 | NA                   | Water depth notes lost |

Only include original data in your dataset as much as possible. Therefore, you should set the missing water depth values to NA and *not* include calculated water depths based on the bathymetric map. Instead, you can use your bathymetry data in the package to automatically derive water depth at the track midpoints during the package workflow. Beware that if no water depth is recorded at all, i.e. the full column will be set to NA, do not include a water depth column as R will read this column to be full of characters 'NA' instead of numeric.   

### Example: Species presence
You sampled with the TripleD, and now want to record which species you found with the minimum of required fields.  

| StationID | EntryID     | Species_reported    | Fraction | is_Fraction_assumed | 
| --------- | ----------- | -----------------   | -------- | ------------------- |
| 64PE330#4 | 64PE330#4_1 | *Asterias rubens*   | 1        | 0                   |
| 64PE330#4 | 64PE330#4_2 | *Abra alba*         | 1        | 0                   |
| 64PE330#4 | 64PE330#4_3 | *Crangon crangon*   | 1        | 0                   |
| 64PE330#4 | 64PE330#4_4 | *Lanice conchilega* | 1        | 0                   |

These are the minimum number of required fields to report species sampled with the TripleD. The StationID is used to match the biological data to the station data (not reported in the other examples for brevity). The EntryID denotes every unique entry. The Species_reported is the name of the species found at that sampling station. The Fraction and is_Fraction_assumed are always required, even if you don't report counts, sizes, or weights. In this case you wrote down presence based on the whole catch so the Fraction is 1 and it is not an assumed fraction (=0). Using the data becomes a lot more fun if counts, sizes, and weights are also reported (see other examples).  

### Example: Taxon identification
You found a couple of bivalve *Ensis* specimens that you cannot fully identify, they are either *Ensis ensis* or *Ensis siliqua*.  

**Option 1**
| EntryID     | Species_reported | is_ID_confident | ID_by | is_Preserved | Comment |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------ | ------- |
| 64PE330#4_1 | Ensis sp.        | 1               | D. de Jonge | 1      | Stored in -20 NIOZ freezer under sample number '64PE330#4_1a'. |

**Option 2**
| EntryID     | Species_reported | is_ID_confident | ID_by | is_Preserved | Comment |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------ | ------- |
| 64PE330#4_1 | Ensis siliqua    | 0               | D. de Jonge | 1      | Stored in -20 NIOZ freezer under sample number '64PE330#4_1a'. |

If you are not sure about the taxonomic identification, the best option is to report the taxonomic level you are sure about. In other words, species names are preferred in the column 'Species_reported' but other taxonomic levels are also allowed as long as the scientific name is used. In the example under consideration you are sure the bivalve belongs to the genus *Ensis* so you report *Ensis sp.* (could also simply be *Ensis*, but avoid *Ensis spec.* or *Ensis species* as the taxa matching algorithm does not like this notation). If you are almost sure about an identification, but not quite, you may choose to report the taxon you think it correct but identify your doubt about the identification in the column 'is_ID_confident'. It is best practice to store specimens with unsure ID, so that later identification in the lab can take place e.g. through barcoding. You can identify specimens that are stored in the column 'is_Preserved' and use the comment section to write where to find the stored sample.  

### Example: Specimen counts
In your full catch you find 10 sea stars *Asterias rubens*, 5 specimens of shrimp *Crangon crangon*, an egg mass of *Abra alba*, and a large clump of tube worms *Lanice conchilega*.  

| EntryID     | Species_reported    | Fraction | is_Fraction_assumed | Count | Comment |
| ----------- | -----------------   | -------- | ------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| 64PE330#4_1 | *Asterias rubens*   | 1        | 0                   | 10    |  NA     |
| 64PE330#4_2 | *Abra alba*         | 1        | 0                   | -1    | Egg mass |
| 64PE330#4_3 | *Crangon crangon*   | 1        | 0                   | 5     | Snouts |
| 64PE330#4_4 | *Lanice conchilega* | 1        | 0                   | NA    | Large clump |

Some species are easily counted and reported. For some species, like *Lanice conchilega*, counting is sometimes omitted. In the latter case, you do want to report the presence but without counts, so the column 'Count' is set to NA, i.e. *not* to zero (it is recommended to include biomass in these cases, examples below). If you observe any items of interest which are not specimens (like egg masses or algae batches), set the count to -1 (again *not* to zero). Use the 'Comment' column to provide additional insight into your specimens and notations.  


### Example: Reporting fractions
In a sample, 20 sea stars *Asterias rubens* were found, but only 4 representative specimens were measured and weighed.   

| EntryID     | Species_reported  | Fraction | is_Fraction_assumed | Count |
| ----------- | ----------------  | -------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| 64PE330#4_1 | *Asterias rubens* | 0.2      | 0                   | 1     |
| 64PE330#4_2 | *Asterias rubens* | 0.2      | 0                   | 1     |
| 64PE330#4_3 | *Asterias rubens* | 0.2      | 0                   | 1     |
| 64PE330#4_4 | *Asterias rubens* | 0.2      | 0                   | 1     |

Note that the reported 'Fraction' is the overall fraction of the catch of the reported species that was processed i.e. 4/20. It is NOT the fraction that each specimen makes up (1/20). You specifically noted the fraction, so the fraction is not assumed (=0). If you are not sure about the fraction, and you have to estimate this afterwards, it would have been 1. Also note that the counts are *not yet corrected* for the fraction.    

The columns with potential size and weights are omitted in this example.

### Example: Size measurements
You process 4 specimens of the seastar *Asterias rubens* (like the previous example) of different sizes, of which one is missing some arms. You also process 13 specimens of *Abra alba*, of which 5 specimens fall within the same size class, another 6 fall within the same size class, and you find two siphons without complete shells. You found a large clump of tube worms *Lanice conchilega* which you did not count, but you did estimate the volume of the colony. You also found a large specimen of the squid *Alloteuthis sp.* of which you  measured both the mantle length and the length including tentacles.  

| EntryID     | Species_reported  | Count | Size_dimension | Size_unit | Size_value | Comment |
| ----------- | ----------------  | ----- | -------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 64PE330#4_1 | *Asterias rubens*   | 1   | Max_length     | cm        | 9          | NA      |
| 64PE330#4_2 | *Asterias rubens*   | 1   | Max_length     | cm        | 9          | NA      |

Recording size measurements is a bit more complex than recording counts. You always need three grouped attributes: Size_dimension (describing what morphology was measured), Size_unit (describing what unit the value is in), and Size_value (the actual measured size value). The Size_dimension is important, because it determines which regression formula can be used to estimate biomass from the reported size.  

You can report one size value per specimen (in the case of *Asterias rubens* in this example), or you can report a size value for a group of specimens (in the case of *Abra alba* in this example).  

You can report different size dimensions and size units for one species if necessary. In this case example some *Asterias rubens* specimens are measured arm tip to arm tip (Max_length) whereas for one specimen the disc diameter is measured (Disc_diameter) because arms were missing in this specific broken organism. Also, for some specimens of *Abra alba* the Shell_length is measured in 1/2cm, and the Siphon_width is measured in mm for two broken specimens.  

Beware of the use of 1/2cm as unit: it describes size classes (read the note under 2.B.), and it allows a size class of 0 1/2cm which does not mean 'no size' but 'between 0 and 5 mm'. If you did not measure a specimen, simply put 'NA' in all three size related columns.  

This format does not allow the specification of multiple sizes for one specimen; each entry must really only represent the number of counted organism reported. In this example, two sizes are known for the squid *Alloteuthis sp.*. However, only one size can be reported (in this case it was chosen to report Mantle_length as official size, and note the other measurement in the comments). Reporting both sizes would require an additional entry, with the interpretation that two specimens were caught, which is not correct of course.  

For some species, like sponges, tunicates, and colony-forming organisms, it is difficult to identify and measure a specific size dimension. In this cases it is possible to report (an estimated) area (in mm2 or cm2) or volume (in mm3 or cm3).  

### Example: Wet weight measurements
The specimens under 'Example: Size measurements' were also weighed. Additionally you weigh a hermit crab *Pagurus bernhardus* that was retrieved without a shell, six specimens of *Arctica islandica* for a study of size-weight relationships (shell lengths are already recorded to be 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 and 3 cm), and 10 large *Ensis ensis* specimens. A while later you find three additional *Ensis ensis* specimens you initially missed because they are smaller. You manage to measure their sizes, but do not have time to weigh them. You use a scale that can only record weights of 0.5 g or larger.  

You find that all four specimens of *Asterias rubens* (of which one was missing some arms) together have a wet weight of 15 g. You find that the 11 complete specimens of *Abra alba* together weigh 7 grams, and that the 2 siphons with some shell remains together weigh less than the scale threshold (i.e. an exact weight cannot be determined). The *Lanice conchilega* colony is 102 grams. The *Alloteuthis sp.* individual is accidentally discarded before it could be weighed. The individual of *Pagurus bernhardus* that was retrieved without a shell weighs 3 grams. The three *Arctica islandica* are measured individually as 3, 6 and 12 g. The 10 large specimens of *Ensis ensis* are 8 grams together.

(Any measured sizes are not shown in the table for simplicity).

Just like size measurements, wet weight measurements are perhaps somewhat complex to note correctly. If you weighed organisms, you always need to include 5 grouped attributes: WW_g (the actual wet weight in grams), Weight_type (defining if the weight concerns one entry or multiple), Threshold_scale (the threshold of the weighing scale used in grams), is_Shell_removed (to identify specimens that naturally occur with an external structure which is removed before weighing), and is_Partial_WW (to identify underestimated wet weights because broken organisms were measured).  

If the reported weight only concerns the counted organisms in one row, the Weight_type is 'Entry', e.g. for *Pagurus bernhardus* and *Arctica islandica* in the example. If the reported weight concerns specimens over multiple entries, the Weight_type is 'Sample', e.g. for *Asterias rubens* in the example. You are allowed to mix 'Entry' and 'Sample' weight types for a reported species in a certain sample (e.g. for *Abra alba* in the example).  

If a (group of) specimen(s) was measured, but the weight was below the scale threshold, note WW_g = 0 and *not* NA (e.g. *Abra alba*). The TripleD package workflow will then estimate the wet weight to be half the Threshold_scale (0.25 g in this example). If the weight was not measured at all, note WW_g = NA (e.g. *Alloteuthis sp.*). The TripleD package workflow will then estimate wet weight based on the size measurement.  

Wet weight measurements with weight type 'Entry' are useful to determine size-weight relationships. In the example of *Arctica islandica* we can calculate that an individual of 1 cm weighs approximately 1.5 g, an individual of 2 cm approximately 3 g, and an individual of 3 cm approximately 6 g (entry weight divided by the count). Entry weights are retained in the 'database_individuals' together with size measurements, whereas sample weights are discarded.  

For density and biomass calculations the TripleD workflow will sum all biomasses, i.e. both entry and sample weights, after conversion using WW to AFDW conversion factors. Assuming a WW_to_AFDW for all organisms of 0.2 when the shell is not removed, and 0.1 when the shell is removed, the final AFDW for each species will be:

| Species_reported    | Count | Sum          | AFDW_g | is_Shell_removed | Underestimation? |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------ | ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| *Asterias rubens*   | 4     | 15 x 0.2                  | 2    | 0 | TRUE |
| *Abra alba*         | 13    | (7 + 2 x 0.5 / 2) x 0.2   | 1.5  | 0 | TRUE |
| *Lanice conchilega* | NA    | 102 x 0.2                 | 20.4 | 0 | FALSE |
| *Alloteuthis sp.*   | 1     | NA                        | NA   | 0 | NA |
| *Pagurus bernhardus* | 1    | 3 x 0.1                   | 0.3  | 1 | FALSE |
| *Arctica islandica* | 6     | (3 + 6 + 12) x 0.2        | 4.2  | 0 | FALSE |
| *Ensis ensis*       | 13    | (8 + NA) x 0.2            | 1.6  | 0 | TRUE |

The column is_Shell_removed guides the workflow of the TripleD package in chosing what type of conversion factor WW_to_AFDW to use. The AFDW values for *Asterias rubens* and *Abra alba* are an underestimation because some of the reported wet weights concerned a partial organism. The AFDW value for *Ensis ensis* is also an underestimation, because of the 13 individuals only 10 were weighed. However, regression formulas might be available to estimate a wet weight from size measurements, which an be applied in the case of the missing weight measurements of *Ensis ensis*.
