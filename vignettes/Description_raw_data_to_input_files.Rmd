# Stations
# General remarks
test_Lavaleye: The raw data included station info together with biological data. The "remove duplicates" function in Excel was used to only keep one entry per station.  
## StationID
test_Lavaleye: The column 'StCode' is used as StationID.
## Date
test_Lavaleye: Already reported in correct format.
## Lat_start_DD and Lon_start_DD
test_Lavaleye: Not available.
## Lat_stop_DD and Lon_stop_DD
test_Lavaleye: Not available. 
## Lat_DD_midpt and Lon_DD_midpt
test_Lavaleye: Reported, but unclear how these were obtained: ship or dredge positions? Midpoint of track?
## Track_length_m_Odo
## Blade_depth_cm
test_Laveleye: depth of blade is not recorded. For now assumed 20 cm, is this correct for all data? In prototype paper other possible depths were also recorded.
## Blade_width_cm
test_Laveleye: width is blade width in meters, so multiplied x100 to obtain value in cm. 
## Vessel
test_Laveleye: Not available.
## CruiseID
test_Laveleye: CruiseID is Cruise in raw data.
## Cruise_name
test_Laveleye: Cruise_name is CruiseName in raw data.
## Station_name
test_Laveleye: can we use Station in raw data for this field?
## Region
test_Laveleye: Available in raw data.
## Time_start and Time_stop
test_Laveleye: Not available.
## Tow_speed_knots
test_Laveleye: Not available.
## Water_depth_m_cruise
test_Laveleye: Available, unclear how these values are obtained.

# Species
## General remarks
The density, biomass, and length data in the RWS2018 and RWS2019 dataset are reported in different tabs. These were merged manually into a CSV in the right format as required for this package as described below.

## StationID
test_Lavaleye: StCode is same as StationID.   

RWS2019: Station ID is RWS31144108#<station nr reported before _ column Loc_name> using the Excelcode: ="RWS31144108#"&LEFT(A2,FIND("_",A2)-1).  

## Fraction
test_Lavaleye: Taken from raw data.  

RWS2019: Fraction was calculated as 1/"FCT-A".

## isFractionAssumed
test_Lavaleye: isFractionAssumed is based on the column AssumedFraction in raw data. In this case the column was empty, so all fractions were set to isFractionAssumed = 0.

RWS2018/2019: Specifically given in original data file, so set to 0.

## Species_reported
test_Lavaleye: Taken from raw data.    
RWS2018/2019: "PAR_Name" is used.  

## Count
test_Lavaleye: "Number" column is taken as Count.   

RWS2019: "AMT_MEAS" was used. Some species were recorded with an 'AMT_MEAS' of 0 and a 'IND_MEAS' of >, meaning they could not be counted properly or that it was decided not to count them. The count of these species was set to NA.

## Unit_Length
test_Lavaleye: 'unit length' taken for Unit_Length. 0.5cm was converted to 1/2cm. na was converted to NA.  
RWS2018/2019: From the tab 'Analyse bestand lengte' can be seen all measurements were reported in mm.  

## Length
test_Lavaleye: reported in raw data.  
RWS2019: The lengths from the tab 'Analyse bestand lengte' was used. If length was not recorded for species that were present in tabs 'Analyse bestand densiteit' and 'Analyse bestand biomassa' Length was set to NA.

## Unit_Width
NICO10 cruise (64PE438):    

test_Lavaleye: 'unit length' taken for Unit_Width if the notes in the original file mention the measured dimension is in fact width not length.  

## Width
test_Lavaleye: The values reported in 'Width' are used, or the values in 'Length' if the notes/comments in the file mention that the value actually concerns a width not length.    

## WetWeight_g
test_Lavaleye: scale gWweight with shell is WetWeight(g).  
RWS2019: The values reported in the column 'WW_MEAS' in the tab 'Analyse bestand biomassa' and 'Analyse bestand biomassa (Vis)' was used, and multiplied by 1000 to get from the reported kg to the required g. If wet weight was not reported it was set to NA. If wet weight was below the threshold it was set to 0.  

## WeightType
NICO10 cruise (64PE438):  
RWS2019: Most of the reported wet weights were sample bulk weights, so BulkWeightType = Sample. This was changed to NA if only one individual was reported.  

## Threshold_Scale
test_Lavaleye: NA.  
RWS2019: Some species are reported as < 0.0005 kg, so the threshold of the scale was 0.5 g.  

## isWithShell
test_Lavaleye: NA (for now).  
RWS2019: Set to 0, unless specified in the comments that it concerns a weight includion shell or tube 'inclusief schelp'.  

## isPartialWW
test_Lavaleye: NA (for now).  
RWS2019: Set to 0, unless specified in the comments that it concerns fragments.  

## AFDW_g
RWS2019: NA (no AFDW reported).  

## BulkWeightTypeAFDW
RWS2019: NA (no AFDW reported).  

## Threshold_ScaleAFDW
RWS2019: NA (no AFDW reported).  

## isPartialAFDW
RWS2019: NA (no AFDW reported).  

## ID_by
RWS2018/2019: "Controle" is used. Empty spaces filled with NA using Excel Find & Select > Go To Special > Select Blanks > OK > "NA" > ctrl+enter.

## isPreserved
test_Lavaleye: Preserved is isPreserved. NA (for now).  

## Comment
NICO10 cruise (64PE438):  

test_Lavaleye: Remark is used for Comment. Empty cells filled with NA.  

RWS2018/2019: "RMK_MEAS" from the density and biomass tabs are used.
